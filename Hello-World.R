setwd("Z:/GitHub/hello-world")
main.dir<-"Z:/GitHub/"

# in terminal:
git clone https://github.com/StewartResearch/hello-world.git

# now make some changes

# git commit-m
# add a git message

# git commit
# add to repository

# git push
# push/sync with github.com

# git pull
# pulls down from github

# git clone
# clones the git repositories

# git branch
# check wich branch you are on


######################################## the above only works within the directory of each repository

# git add

# git addA

# git
# tells you all of the git commands

##########################################
# an example from the terminal:
# with my mistakes imbedded


# generally type:
# git add .

# git commit -m "[your message here]"

# git push

# the above will update all files in the repository
# but the message will be specific to anything that is changed
# you can then double check the push by going to the GitHub URL for that repository
# OR, you can go to GitKraken or some other platform you may be using.

# ALWAYS REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR FILES IN R/RSTUDIO 
#  Git will only update what has been saved.
